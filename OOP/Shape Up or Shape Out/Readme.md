# Shape Up Or Shape Out
The purpose of this lab is to help solidify the OOP Class inheritance concepts you've learned from the lectures.

* You will be building a webpage that will enable users to draw shapes of varying sizes on the screen
* When a shape is clicked, you should update the sidepanel with the metrics for that shape
* Each type of shape will have its own input box(es) for getting size information, and an insert button for drawing the shape on the page
